I’m a designer based in Zaragoza, Spain, always eager to learn more while creating meaningful work. I am a dedicated team player that enjoys working closely with others.  

I’ve worked on a variety of projects and for many countries, from software to mobile apps or data visualisation dashboards, which helped me to learn other points of view.

Outside of work, you’ll likely catch me going for a vermouth, doing yoga, or playing Wild Rift and board games.
