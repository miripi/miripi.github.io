My name is Mirian Durán and I’ve been working as a web designer and front-end developer on complex platforms related to manufacturing and healthcare for over 10 years, more specifically as UX+UI designer the last 5 years.

As the nature of most of my business work is confidential, I won’t be able to show many visuals for the time being. However, my portfolio will provide you a more detailed description of what I’ve done and how I work.
